# Resopurge

### Removes image files smaller than some specified width/height

This program depends on the Pillow library to determine the size of images. To install this package, run

```
pip install Pillow
```

You should then configure the variables on top of the script to point to the correct path, and set the image dimensions. Then run the script with:

```
python3 resopurge.py
```
